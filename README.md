# Newsvendor Simulation Game
This is a simple simulation of `newsvendor inventory problem`. You play as `B` against `A` who always input optimal order size. In each round, you have to place your order by inputting an integer number. At the round you'll see how much profit you and your opponent got.

### Notes
For now if you want to change the setting of the game (number of rounds, price, etc.) you have to change the constants in the code.
